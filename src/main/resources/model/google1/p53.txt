TP53 tumor protein p53 Homo sapiens This gene encodes tumor protein p53 which responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis senescence
The p53 tumor suppressor protein Genes and Disease NCBI The p53 gene like the Rb gene is a tumor suppressor gene ie its activity stops the formation of tumors If a person inherits only one functional copy of the p53
p53 induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells by The tumour suppressor p53 becomes activated in response to upstream stress signals such as DNA damage and causes cellcycle arrest or apoptosis
The p53mdm2 autoregulatory feedback loop The p53 protein can bind to a set of specific DNA sequences and this may activate the transcription of genes adjacent to these DNA elements The mdm2 gene
p53 has a direct apoptogenic role at the mitochondria Mol Cell 2003 Mar11357790 p53 has a direct apoptogenic role at the mitochondria Mihara M Erster S Zaika A Petrenko O Chittenden T Pancoska P Moll
Posttranslational modification of p53 in tumorigenesis Interest in the tumour suppressor p53 has generated much information regarding the complexity of its function and regulation in carcinogenesis However gaps
The Isoforms of the p53 Protein p53 is a transcription factor with a key role in the maintenance of genetic stability and therefore preventing cancer formation It belongs to a family of genes
Regulating the p53 pathway in vitro hypotheses in vivo veritas Mutations in TP53 the gene that encodes the tumour suppressor p53 are found in 50% of human cancers and increased levels of its negative regulators MDM2
Transcriptional control of human p53regulated genes The p53 protein regulates the transcription of many different genes in response to a wide variety of stress signals Following DNA damage p53 regulates key
Acetylation of p53 at lysine 373/382 by the histone deacetylase Generally histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitorinduced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression is thought to be p53 independent Here we found that an inhibitor of HDAC
